<h1>Party Planner</h1>
A simple party planner application using Sinatra framework with ActiveRecord from Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL Database

To create a database for this project and use the application you must have PostgreSQL installed on your machine.

After cloning, from the command line, type the following:

<code>bunde exec bundle install</code>
<code>bundle exec rake db:create</code>
<code>bundle exec rake db:migrate</code>
<code>bundle exec rake db:seed</code>

The project will now be seeded with some great friend names from the Faker gem!

Start planning your parties with all your new friends!
